Assigned on Aug 4th, 2016 - this app was a 2-hour test at Prime Digital Academy after learning jQuery.

The goal was to list out spies that were "hired" by an imaginary company. Each spy would have the option to be listed as "In Danger" or "Deceased" and be deleted. A running count of total spies hired was also required to pass the test.

Since the test, I've improved the app for practice.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JS/JQuery
