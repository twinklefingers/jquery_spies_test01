the agency wants to
know when a spy is in danger
remove lost spies from their spy roster


Adding a Spy

What: HR needs to be able to add new spies to the list.

How: When the page loads, create a button on the DOM that says Add Spy. Upon clicking that button, add a new spy to the DOM.

HINT: You'll need to append a new container onto the DOM.

Spy Container Details

What: Each spy will have a unique ID number. The state of the spy can change from cautious (yellow) to danger (red) and vice versa. And, lost spies can be removed from our listing.

How: As a default, the background color of each Spy container should be yellow.

It should also have two buttons

Change button changes the background color to red, if yellow OR yellow, if red.
Delete button removes the spy container altogether. This button should delete JUST the container that button is in.
Finally, there should be text that provides a number in the container. The number should be the number of times the Add Spy button has been clicked so far.

REMEMBER: Do not add in anything additional beyond what is required. The goal is not to be clever here, it is to execute on the provided instructions.
